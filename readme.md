Convert Word Documents to HTML
==============================

Cleans up the otherwise-ugly output generated by Microsoft Word when you use the File -> Save As HTML option.

* Removes uneccessary tags and attributes, such as inline CSS and extraneous IDs
* Cleans up encoding problems and HTML entities
* Balances tags to ensure valid HTML
* Typesets everything via the Texturize engine
* Converts Word's footnotes into a format compatible with Bootstrap's tooltips

Usage
-----

1. Modify `convert.php` to point to the file (or name it `index.html` and place it in the same folder as this script)
1. Visit convert.php in your browser
1. Copy and paste the output from the text area
